.Dt POSIXMQCONTROL 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm posixmqcontrol
.Nd Control POSIX mqueuefs message queues
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar create
.Fl q Ar queue
.Fl s Ar size
.Fl d Ar depth
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Nm
.Ar info
.Fl q Ar queue
.Nm
.Ar recv
.Fl q Ar queue
.Nm
.Ar rm
.Fl q Ar queue
.Nm
.Ar send
.Fl q Ar queue
.Fl c Ar content
.Op Fl p Ar priority
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command manipulates the named POSIX message queue. It allows creating
queues, inspecting queue metadata, altering group and user access
to queues, dumping queue contents, and unlinking queues.
.Pp
Unlinking removes the name from the system and frees underlying memory.
.Pp
The maximum message size, maximum queue size, and current queue depth are
displayed by the
.Ic info
subcommand. This output is similar to running
.Ic cat
on a mqueuefs queue mounted under a mount point. This utility requires
.Ic mqueuefs
kernal module to be loaded but does not require
.Ic mqueuefs
to be mounted as a file system.
.Pp
The following subcommands are provided:
.Bl -tag -width truncate
.It Ic create
Create the named queues, if they do not already exist. More than one
queue name may be created. The same depth and size are used to create
all queues. If a queue exists, then the depth are size are optional.
.Pp
The required
.Ar size
and
.Ar depth
arguments specify the maxmimum message size and maxmimum message depth.
The optional numerical
.Ar mode
argument specifies the initial access mode. If the queue exists but does
not match the requested size and depth, this utility will attempt to recreate
the queue by first unlinking and then creating it. This will fail if the
queue is not empty or is opened by other processes.
.It Ic rm
Unlink the queues specified - one attempt per queue. Failure to unlink one
queue does not stop this sub-command from attempting to unlink the others.
.It Ic info
For each named queue, dispay the maximum message size, maximum queue size,
current queue depth, user owner id, group owner id, and mode permission bits.
.It Ic recv
Wait for a message from a single named queue and display the message to
standard output.
.It Ic send
Send messages to one or more named queues. If multiple messages and multiple
queues are specified, the utility attempts to send all messages to all queues.
The optional -p priority, if omitted, defaults to MQ_PRIO_MAX / 2 or medium
priority.
.El
.Sh SUMMARY
.Nm
allows you to move POSIX message queue administration out of your
applications. Defining and adjusting queue attributes can be done
without touching application code. To avoid down-time when altering
queue attributes, consider creating a new queue and configure reading
applications to drain both new and old queues. Retire the old queue
once all writers have been updated to write to the new queue.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Bl -bullet
.It
EX_NOTAVAILABLE usually means the mqueuefs kernel module is not loaded.
.It
EX_USAGE reports one or more incorrect parameters.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -bullet
.It
To retrieve the current message from a named queue,
.Pa /1 ,
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol recv -q /1"
.It
To create a queue with the name
.Pa /2
with message size 100 and maximum queue depth 10,
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol create -q /2 -s 100 -d 10"
.It
To send a message to a queue with the name
.Pa /3
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol send -q /3 -c 'some choice words.'"
.It
To examine attributes of a queue named
.Pa /4
use the command
.Dl "posixmqcontrol info -q /4"
